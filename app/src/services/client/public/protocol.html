      <h1>Protocol</h1>
      <hr>

      <p><a href="https://cypherpost.io">cypherpost</a> is a trust-minimized, end-to-end encrypted, data storage & sharing protocol.</p>
      <p>Data is stored & shared through a central server, and since all data is e2ee, server admins have no incentive to
        censor or deny service to any specific user. Users can also chose to run their own cypherpost servers with
        minimal effort if they so chose.</p>
      <p>Servers offer dumb data storage facility and network discovery, while clients define their application specific data models and how to use it.</p>
      <p>Its first application; implemented by this reference client, allows inviduals to discover peers and post
        Bitcoin BUY/SELL advertisements in a private and pure peer-to-peer fashion.</p>
      <p>Other clients can define their own use-cases enforced on the client-side; while cypherpost servers are unaware
        of how clients are using the data being posted.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Portable Accounts</h3>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/i5hi/cypherpost">cypherpost</a> uses ECDH keys and leverages the simiplicity of
        <b>BIP39</b> mnemonic word master key; to achieve a more portable form of e2ee and client authentication.</p>
      <p>Auth does not require passwords, emails or phone numbers since clients are expected to hold ECDH keys; which have more
        entropy than 99.9% of passwords currently in use.</p>
      <p>Authentication is simply providing a signature with every request using the client's identity key; with the
        message being the request data and a nonce.</p>
      <p>This allows users to back-up a single mnemonic as they are used to with Bitcoin - with which they can recover
        their entire account on any device; without complicated device registrations and old authentication methods that
        rely on weak passwrds, third-parties and ultimately access tokens that live beyond each individual request.</p>
      <p>It also uses <b>BIP32</b> HD Key standard to easily rotate keys per post; where forward secrecy is required.</p>
      <br />

      <h3>Badges</h3>
      <p>Reputation and classification of users on <a href="https://cypherpost.io">cypherpost</a> is
        achieved through issuance of badges. </p>
      <p>Giving someone a 'Trusted' badge, not only adds to their overall reputation but also specifically allows users
        to classify others into groups and more easily set visibility of their data.</p>
      <p>The value of a badge is subjective. If a user has 100 Trusted badges and only 10 of them are from users that
        you have given a badge to, then these 10 badges are more meaningful than the remaining 90.</p>
      <p>Cypherpost currently supports 3 badges: Trusted, Scammer & MetInPerson.</p>
      <p>When a user gives another user a badge, a special signature and nonce is required in addition to auth, that all
        clients can view and verify, to ensure that network reputation is legitimate.</p>
        <p>Badges allow users to more easily discover each other and build a web of trust.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Client-side Verification</h3>
      <p>Clients of cypherpost define their own data models and store them as encrypted stringified JSON. 
        They simply PUT, GET or DELETE this JSON from servers.</p>
      <p>This radically changes the client-server relationship that we are used to in the web we use today - where clients
        hand over all their data in plain-text to servers to do various computational work on.</p>
      <p>With cypherpost, clients are enabled with basic cryptographic tools to truly own their data and create an
        application protocol without servers needing to know any specific details.</p>

      <h2>Mechanism</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>ECDH Shared Secret</h3>
      <p>At the core of the e2ee model is the ECDH shared secret.</p>
      <p>All clients must implement a primary 'identity' key pair comprised of a public key and private key.</p>
      <p>Given two users, Alice and Bob; both can compute the same shared secret with their private key and the other's
        public key.</p>
      <p>This shared secret is used to encrypt the key that is used to encrypt/decrypt cypher_json posts.</p>
      <p>If a user is trusting 10 other users, they only encrypt their data with a primary key; and then, encrypt this
        key with a shared secret computed for each of their trusted users (creating 10 copies of encrypted keys) and
        share the encrypted key with each of them via the server. Each recipient can then decrypt them on their client and use it to view the
        data.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Bitcoin Keys</h3>
      <p>The BIP32 key derivation model is used to derive an infinite amount of child keys that are used to
        encrypt/decrypt all data flowing through cypherpost. This is done by deriving a new key from the user's master
        key which is derived from a BIP39 seed.</p>
      <p>We use the following path standard: <span class=""><b>m/purpose'/network'/usecase'/index'/revoke'</b></span>
      </p>
      <p>This reference client defines 3 use-cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IDENTITY: Used to sign requests (authentication) and compute shared secrets.</li>
        <li>PREFERENCE: Used to encrypt/decrypt preferences. We store our mute_list and last_used_derivation_paths here
          to ensure we rotate keys consistently.</li>
        <li>TRADE: Used to encrypt/decrypt trades.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Other clients can define custom data models based on their own use-cases.</p>

      <p>More information can be found at <a
          href="https://github.com/i5hi/cypherpost/blob/main/docs/KeyManagement.md">KeyManagement in cypherpost.</a></p>
      <h3>CypherJSON</h3>
      <p>Users post data to cypherpost as encrypted stringified JSON.</p>
      <p>Clients define their own fields, usually with a common `type` field. This allows them to differentiate different types of models.</p>
      <p>Each different `type` should also use a dedicated key derivation path at the `usecase` path; to encrypt/decrypt
        and rotate encryption keys.</p>
      <p>When a client decrypts cypher_json it first checks the type and then accordingly updates its state.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Known-Issues</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Spam Accounts</h3>
      <p>One advantage of using emails or phone numbers is in preventing spam. Since cypherpost does not use these
        authentication methods and uses a more open pubkey and signature based system, it is more vulnerable to spam
        accounts.</p>
      <p>The way this is resolved is by server admins charging a registration fee in satoshis. Users can chose to run
        their own servers if this fee is not justified.</p>
      <h3>Spam Posts</h3>
      <p>Since post visibility is set by the creator of the post and not the reciever, one can be spammed with posts
        from other users.</p>
      <p>To overcome this, clients must maintain a 'PREFERENCE' post type, where they can keep a list of 'Muted'
        pubkeys, and ignore posts from these users.</p>
